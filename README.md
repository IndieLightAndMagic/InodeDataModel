# InodeDataModel

This project is a data model library for things modelled as network oriented. For example an ISP will have a Router(Main Node) will have last mile devices (Sub Nodes) and finally customers (Leaf Nodes).

Nodes are modelled with two vectors of links to other nodes. The first vector is a node which depicts children / sink nodes, the second would depict parents / source nodes. 

This is still in very first stages. Will be used for some prototypes. 

More to come. .......
